<h1>About the Peterborough Examiner: Local Journalism in Peterborough</h1>

<article>

<section id="mission-and-standards">
<h2>Mission, Standards, and Community Role</h2>

<p>The Peterborough Examiner serves as a vital source of local journalism for Peterborough, Ontario, and the surrounding region. Our mission is to provide accurate, timely, and comprehensive coverage of the news, events, and issues that matter most to our community. As an examiner newspaper Ontario publication, we recognize our responsibility to inform, engage, and empower residents through independent reporting that holds institutions accountable and celebrates community achievements.</p>

<p>Local journalism plays an essential role in civic life. In Peterborough, where municipal decisions affect daily life—from transit routes to housing policy, from school board budgets to environmental initiatives—residents deserve clear, factual reporting that helps them understand complex issues and participate meaningfully in democratic processes. The Peterborough Examiner exists to bridge the gap between government, institutions, and the people they serve, ensuring transparency and fostering informed public discourse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Our commitment is to accuracy first, speed second. Every story we publish must meet rigorous standards for verification, attribution, and fairness. When we make mistakes, we correct them promptly and transparently."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our editorial standards are built on core principles of journalism ethics. We verify information through multiple sources before publication, clearly attribute statements and data to their origins, and maintain a strict separation between news reporting and opinion content. We do not publish rumors or unconfirmed allegations. When covering breaking news, we clearly label preliminary information and update stories as facts become available. Our reporters are trained to recognize bias, seek diverse perspectives, and present information in a balanced manner that allows readers to form their own conclusions.</p>

<p>Transparency is fundamental to our operation. We maintain a formal corrections policy that requires us to acknowledge and fix errors as soon as they are identified. Corrections are published prominently, not hidden in fine print. We also disclose potential conflicts of interest and explain our sourcing methods when appropriate. Readers who believe we have made an error or who have concerns about our coverage are encouraged to contact us directly—we take every inquiry seriously and respond in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Our coverage priorities reflect the needs and interests of Peterborough residents. We focus on stories that have genuine public interest: decisions that affect taxpayers, policies that impact quality of life, developments that shape the community's future, and events that bring people together. We cover city hall proceedings, public safety updates, education news, healthcare developments, environmental issues, court proceedings, business openings and closures, sports achievements, and cultural events. Our goal is not simply to report what happened, but to explain why it matters and what comes next.</p>

<p>The Peterborough Examiner operates within the framework of Canadian press freedom, a fundamental right protected by the <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/" rel="external">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>. We take this responsibility seriously, understanding that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press" rel="external">freedom of the press</a> exists not for the benefit of journalists, but for the benefit of the public. A free press serves as a check on power, a forum for diverse voices, and a record of community history.</p>

<p>For more information about how we operate and what readers can expect from our coverage, please visit our <a href="/faq">frequently asked questions page</a> or return to our <a href="/">home page</a> to see the latest Peterborough local news and community updates.</p>

<h2>Coverage Desks: Business, Sports, Events, Breaking News</h2>

<p>The Peterborough Examiner newsroom is organized into specialized coverage desks, each focused on a particular area of community life. This structure ensures that reporters develop deep expertise in their beats, build relationships with key sources, and provide consistent, informed coverage over time. Our desk system allows us to balance breaking news responsiveness with thoughtful, in-depth reporting on complex issues.</p>

<h3>How We Choose Stories</h3>
<p>Our editorial team evaluates potential stories using these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> How many people are affected, and how significantly?</li>
<li><strong>Timeliness:</strong> Is this happening now, or does it have immediate relevance?</li>
<li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Does this directly concern Peterborough and area residents?</li>
<li><strong>Public interest:</strong> Do residents need or want to know this information?</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Does this story hold institutions or officials accountable?</li>
<li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Is this unusual, unexpected, or particularly noteworthy?</li>
<li><strong>Human interest:</strong> Does this story connect with readers on a personal level?</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>Our reporters work closely with sources throughout the community, including municipal officials, police and fire services, school administrators, business owners, community organizations, and residents. We attend public meetings, review official documents, file freedom of information requests when necessary, and conduct interviews to gather firsthand accounts. This on-the-ground reporting distinguishes local journalism from aggregated or wire service content.</p>

<p>The Peterborough Examiner also collaborates with other Canadian news organizations when appropriate. We subscribe to <a href="https://www.thecanadianpress.com/" rel="external">The Canadian Press</a> for national and international news that affects our readers, and we reference authoritative sources such as academic institutions like <a href="https://www.trentu.ca/library" rel="external">Trent University Library</a> when researching complex topics. However, our primary focus remains original, locally-generated reporting that cannot be found elsewhere.</p>

<details>
<summary>Corrections and Updates</summary>
<p>When we make an error—whether factual, contextual, or typographical—we correct it as quickly as possible. Minor errors such as misspelled names or incorrect titles are fixed immediately, with a correction note added to the article. Significant errors that affect the meaning or interpretation of a story receive prominent correction notices at the top of the article, explaining what was wrong and what has been corrected.</p>
<p>We also update stories as new information becomes available, particularly for breaking news and developing situations. Updates are clearly labeled with timestamps, and we preserve the context of earlier reporting rather than simply overwriting it. This approach allows readers to understand how a story evolved and demonstrates our commitment to transparency.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Archives Approach</summary>
<p>The Peterborough Examiner maintains comprehensive archives of our published content, creating a valuable historical record of community events and developments. Our archives are searchable and accessible to readers who want to research past coverage, track issues over time, or simply revisit stories of personal interest.</p>
<p>Archived articles are preserved in their original form, with correction notices added when applicable. We do not remove or alter archived content except in extraordinary circumstances involving legal requirements or significant privacy concerns. This archival integrity ensures that our journalism serves not only today's readers but also future researchers, historians, and community members seeking to understand Peterborough's past.</p>

We aim to be a trusted source not just for what's happening, but for what readers need to know to take action.</p>

<p>When submitting a correction request, please be as specific as possible. Include the article URL or headline, identify the exact error, provide the correct information, and if possible, cite a source for the correction. This helps us verify and fix errors quickly. We take all correction requests seriously, even if we ultimately determine that our original reporting was accurate—in such cases, we will explain our reasoning.</p>

<p>For story tips, context is crucial. Tell us not just what happened, but why it matters to the Peterborough community. If you have documents, photos (described in text), or other supporting materials, mention their availability. While we cannot pursue every tip we receive, we review all submissions and prioritize those with the greatest public interest and newsworthiness.</p>

<p>The Peterborough Examiner operates independently but within the broader context of Canadian civic institutions. For matters outside our scope, we recommend contacting appropriate authorities directly. The <a href="https://www.peterborough.ca/en/city-services/contact-us.aspx" rel="external">City of Peterborough contact directory</a> provides access to municipal services, while the <a href="https://www.ombudsman.on.ca/" rel="external">Ontario Ombudsman</a> handles complaints about provincial government services.</p>

<p>Our commitment to Peterborough local news extends beyond daily reporting. We see ourselves as partners in building a more informed, engaged, and connected community. By maintaining high journalistic standards, responding to reader needs, and continuously improving our coverage, we strive to earn and keep your trust every day.</p>
