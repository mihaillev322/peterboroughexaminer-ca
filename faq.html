<h2>How to Read and Verify Local Reporting</h2>

<p>Understanding how journalism works helps readers evaluate news coverage and distinguish verified reporting from speculation, opinion, or misinformation. The Peterborough Examiner follows established journalism ethics and practices, and we encourage readers to approach all news—from any source—with informed critical thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Verification is the foundation of journalism. Before publishing, we confirm facts through multiple reliable sources, official documents, or direct observation. When information cannot be independently verified, we clearly attribute it to sources and note limitations in our knowledge."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professional journalism distinguishes between news reporting and opinion content. News articles present verified facts, include multiple perspectives when relevant, and avoid editorializing. Opinion pieces, columns, and editorials are clearly labeled and represent the views of individual writers or the editorial board. The <a href="https://caj.ca/ethics-guidelines/" rel="external">Canadian Association of Journalists ethics resources</a> provide detailed guidance on these distinctions and the principles that guide responsible journalism.</p>

<aside>
<h3>Tip Checklist for Evaluating News Coverage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Check publication date and any update timestamps to ensure information is current</li>
<li>Look for named sources and attribution explaining how reporters obtained information</li>
<li>Note whether multiple sources confirm key facts or whether claims remain unverified</li>
<li>Distinguish between what is confirmed and what is alleged, suspected, or under investigation</li>
<li>Consider whether coverage includes relevant context and multiple perspectives</li>
<li>Check whether the publication has a corrections policy and how errors are addressed</li>
<li>Evaluate whether headlines accurately reflect article content without sensationalizing</li>
<li>Cross-reference important claims with official sources or other reputable news outlets</li>
</ul>
</aside>

<p>The Peterborough Examiner maintains transparency about our reporting processes and limitations. When we cannot independently verify information, we say so. When sources request anonymity, we explain why we granted it and what readers should know about the source's credibility and potential biases. When stories are developing and facts remain uncertain, we clearly communicate what is known, what is not yet confirmed, and when readers can expect updates.</p>

<p>Readers who identify potential errors or have questions about our coverage are encouraged to contact our newsroom. We take correction requests seriously and investigate promptly. Verified errors are corrected quickly, with corrections clearly labeled and appended to original articles. Significant errors warrant separate correction notices. This commitment to accuracy and accountability distinguishes professional journalism from other information sources and builds trust with our community.</p>
